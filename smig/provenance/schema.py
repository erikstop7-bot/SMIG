=========================
Pydantic v2 model representing a single epoch's provenance record.

One ProvenanceRecord is created after each detector-simulation epoch
(i.e. after each simulated exposure in a multi-epoch microlensing event).
A list of these records is accumulated by ProvenanceTracker and serialised
as a JSON sidecar alongside the output FITS/HDF5 products.

Pydantic v2 is required (>= 2.0).

    All fields are required at construction time (no defaults) to force the
    caller to populate every provenance dimension explicitly.

    Timezone requirement
    --------------------
    ``timestamp_utc`` uses Pydantic's ``AwareDatetime`` type, which rejects
    naive (timezone-unaware) datetime objects at validation time.  Callers
    must supply a timezone-aware value, e.g.::

        from datetime import datetime, timezone
        ts = datetime.now(timezone.utc)

    NumPy random-state snapshot
    ---------------------------
    The ``random_state`` field holds the dict returned by
    ``numpy.random.Generator.bit_generator.state``, e.g.::

        rng = numpy.random.default_rng(seed=42)
        state = rng.bit_generator.state   # {"bit_generator": "PCG64", ...}

    A field validator (``mode="before"``) recursively sanitizes the dict,
    converting ``np.ndarray`` to lists and ``np.generic`` scalars to native
    Python types so the output is cleanly JSON-serializable.
