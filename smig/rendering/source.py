========================
Phase 2 source-profile rendering for the SMIG v2 pipeline.

Provides :class:`FiniteSourceRenderer`, which renders a single microlensing
source (point source or finite limb-darkened disk) by convolving a base
profile with a caller-supplied PSF and drawing into a pre-allocated GalSim
Image stamp.

Phase 2 module — requires ``galsim``.
Install with: ``pip install -e '.[phase2]'``.

Design notes
------------
* The PSF is **always provided by the caller per call** — no PSF provider is
  stored on the instance.  This keeps the renderer stateless with respect to
  optics and makes it straightforward to swap PSFs across render calls.
* Resolved sources use ``galsim.Sersic(n=1, ...)`` (exponential disk) as a
  limb-darkening approximation when coefficients are provided, and a uniform
  ``galsim.TopHat`` otherwise.  Full non-parametric limb-darkening is a
  Phase 3 deliverable.
* The stamp buffer is owned by the caller.  This method adds flux to
  whatever is already in the buffer (``add_to_image=True``), so callers can
  accumulate multiple sources on a single stamp.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flux_e:
            Total source flux in electrons.
        centroid_offset_pix:
            ``(dx, dy)`` offset from the stamp centre in pixels.  Positive x
            is right, positive y is up (standard GalSim convention).
        rho_star_arcsec:
            Projected stellar radius in arcseconds.  Values ≤
            ``UNRESOLVED_THRESHOLD_ARCSEC`` are treated as point sources.
        limb_darkening_coeffs:
            Two-parameter limb-darkening coefficients ``(u1, u2)``, or
            ``None``.  When provided and the source is resolved, a Sersic
            n=1 (exponential disk) profile is used as an approximation.
            When ``None``, a uniform :class:`galsim.TopHat` is used.
        psf:
            Caller-supplied polychromatic PSF as a
            :class:`galsim.InterpolatedImage`.  Its pixel scale must match
            *stamp*.
        stamp:
            Pre-allocated :class:`galsim.Image` buffer.  The method adds
            rendered flux to existing pixel values (``add_to_image=True``).
